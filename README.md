# IMDB-Web-Scraper

This is a web scraper that scrapes the top 1,000 movies on IMDB according to user ratings. It accounts for the movie title, year of release, runtime,  genre, user score, director and actors. Used beatiful soup to grab and parse out the data, along with pandas and numpy to frame and handle the datasets. Saved to a csv file.
